## If you do not have NPM installed on your machine.

I'm sure you know what the node package manager is and probably have it on your machine,
but I want to make sure to say this in case you don't because I really want this to run. 
If you don't have Node and NPM you can install it by going to [Node's website](https://nodejs.org/) 

## From the command line in the root of my repo folder 

you can run "npm" install" to get all my dependancies which is pretty much just the testing library jest.

## To run the tests from the command line

Run "npm test" 

## The project description

The Kata I chose was the Pencil Durability Kata. I have two main files in this project. 

supplies.js holds all the logic behind the app.It allows you to make a new Pencil and a new Paper and use the pencil on the paper. 

supplies.test.js holds all my tests. 

I tried to commit after each failed test and after each passed test
to show you my best understanding of TDD as it is. This is my first time using TDD and I thought it was very
cool, but I am definitely not a master, so I'm looking forward to your feedback on how I did with it and
how I can improve. I had a few questions about TDD along the way. Some of them I left in the comments but
I am really looking forward to talking about it. 

Also, those last few components of the Kata were very tricky.It was really fun to figure out
and I'm looking forward to the Artisan to fill me in on any secret Artisan magic to clean that portion up. 

Thank you for your time to check this out.
